Graphviz JNI
------------

The JNI classes in the org.graphviz package are automatically generated by
SWIG during the build process of Graphviz (http://graphviz.org/).

The classes included her were generated from Graphviz version 2.26.3. They
should however be compatible up to the current (as of June 2013) stable
version 2.30.1 as the interface has not been changed since then.
